# Nest.js Boilerplate

[![Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/img/logo_text.svg)](https://nestjs.com/)

## Overview

This is a boilerplate for [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) - a powerful Node.js framework that's built with a focus on developer productivity, scalability, and ease of use.

The boilerplate provides a starting point for building robust and scalable applications with Nest.js, incorporating best practices and essential features to accelerate development.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Ready-to-use authentication using [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) with JWT strategy.
- **Database Integration:** Integrated with popular databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling and logging strategies using Nest.js features.
- **Dependency Injection:** Utilizes Nest.js' powerful dependency injection and modular design.
- **Configuration:** Environment-based configuration management using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
- **Validation:** Request validation using Nest.js' built-in validation pipes.
- **Testing:** Setup for unit and integration testing using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).
- **Linting & Formatting:** Integrated with ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Nest.js boilerplate on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development
   # Add other environment variables as needed
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

This section should detail how to use the boilerplate, including how to create controllers, services, and modules, and how to define routes. Provide code examples and explanations to help users understand how to customize the boilerplate for their needs.

## Testing

Explain how to run the tests, including unit and integration tests. Provide examples and guidance on writing tests for different components of the application.
